											Overview												      
Ingo is a social media app for those looking to expand their participation in local and global conversations. Ingo provides the user the opportunity to engage in conversation with local users in a 3-5 mile radius on a public stream of conscious. The top posts for that radius are displayed, ranked and reset daily. Users can also engage in a more private way with their following on a dedicated page. The idea that we want to share some things publicly and others privately is ingrained in ingo, and gives users the chance to do so in the same intuitive app.
